# Anagram Finder

Checks whether two strings are anagrams or not. 
Two words are said to be anagrams of each other if the letters from one word can be rearranged to form the other word. 
From the above definition it is clear that two strings are anagrams if all characters in both strings occur same number of times. 

For example "abc" and "cab" are anagram strings, here every character 'a', 'b' and 'c' occur only one time in both strings.
